# TFM-Code---Mattia-Novelli
This repository contains all the code implemented for the Master's Thesis (TFM) of Mattia Novelli.  
In particular, it includes code aimed at solving an optimization problem consisting in finding a Helmholtz resonator with the smallest possible volume and the lowest possible resonance frequency.  
This optimization is performed using Reinforcement Learning.

In Codici_ausiliari are all the codes necessary to calculate the normalized acoustic input impedance (in the various considered cases) and the resonance frequency.

In Experiment_tuning are the codes used for hyperparameter tuning.

In Pareto are all the codes necessary to compare the obtained Pareto fronts.

In Results are graphs and tables related to the final results (case without end-correction, with internal end-correction, and with both end-corrections).
